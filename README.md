This repository contains the code to perform a product sentiment analysis on IntelÂ® products through online reviews posted on amazon by both technical and general users. 

It implements a basic web scraper to extract the latest reviews, which are used to perform the sentiment analysis and display the analysis results to the user through a simple interface.

The required dependencies or packages can be installed by running the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The code is run on localhost as a web application contained in `main.py` which can be run using the command obtained on running the file, similar to:
```
streamlit run /home/user/airborne/main.py
```
