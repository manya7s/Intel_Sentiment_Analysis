When compare to amd ryzen 7 7000 processors i5 14600k will easily beat in all aspects. But this will consume a lot of power and generate more heat. So we have to take atleast 700W with 80+ certified psu and a good liquid cooler. Any how As usually we can enjoy with this beast.
The seller posted the item but there was a delay from the postal service so they got the item back and posted the item with express delivery instead. Excellent and professional seller!
Installation was great! It was my first time building a PC and nothing went wrong!
Works just fine.  Looking back you can get pretty similar performance on a 13th gen and save like $30, or go up to the I7 which gives you two more performance cores.  It is working great though and cooler than the 14 gen I7 and I9.
The CPU works great, but it was constantly 90C-100C on light duty.Definitely buy an aftermarket cooler.  The intel specs say 154watt power consumption on max load, so 150watt cooler may not be quite enough.I didn't want to take a chance and purchased a dual tower air cooler rated at +250w cooling.  It runs very cool and quiet.
This is a great product at a great price that runs cool with the included cooler. However, every motherboard manufacturer is now OVER VOLTING the CPUs causing them to run hotter and be less efficient so they can pass benchmarks with slightly higher scores at the cost of cooking your CPU. Look up the PL1 (long term power) and PL2 (short term power) ratings for your CPU and compare it to the massive over-volting your motherboard is doing to it without your knowledge or consent.In this case, the PL1 on a 14500 is 65w and the PL2 is 154w. My AsRock board was over-volting this to 219w+!!! No wonder it was cooking the CPU. This is not even an over-clockable CPU!There is a setting in the AsRock BIOS EZ 
The CPU performs great.  Good price.  Probably not for gaming, but I'm not a gamer.The cooler is not sufficient for this CPU.  I had to buy a better one.  I am happy with this one:ID-COOLING SE-224-XTS CPU Cooler 4 Heatpipes CPU Air Cooler 120mm PWM Fan CPU Fan for Intel LGA1700/115X/1200; AMD AM4/AM5I wish Intel would not include the cooler and give the false impression that it will be fine.  Don't cook your CPU; just buy a better one.
This is an upgrade from a 4 core processor I used to have. This CPU feels super fast in comparison. I really love it!I use this for gaming, I've never seen it get even close to 100% usage, but I don't play anything too demanding or at max settings.The fan that it comes with it's a little bit loud, but not enough to bother me, specially since I game with my headphones on. But I like that it comes with thermal paste pre-applied.
Switched to 14500 since my itx build cant handle 13900K, turned out I don’t feel any difference, and the fans don’t need to spin at full speed thus much quieter. For those who do casual office work and surf internet, watch youtube, play casual games, 14500 is very good choice.
I love the chip but I noticed something strange. The stock cooler had hardened thermal paste on it. It looks like this was used and resold at a new price. I have never seen a stock cooler come with thermal paste on it and especially not hardened crusty thermal paste. I had to clean it off with rubbing alcohol. Other than that, the chip is a good one and a nice balance between great performance and efficiency with its 65 TDP. I just can't believe that the stock cooler had thermal paste on it and it appears to be used. I have never had that happen before.
Don't let the naysayers talk you down from this CPU. It has everything you'd want at an amazing value to performance ratio - pair it with any GPU released in the last 6 years and you'll be able to run just about anything at mid-high settings in 1080p-1440p. If you can get on sale too, so much the better.Runs stable and cool even when over locked - just be aware that there's no integrated graphics on this, so you need a dedicated GPU to post if you're building a new rig.
if you have a 13th gen dont upgrade.
Intel i5 1440 10 Core/16Thread/with Intel 730 UHD graphics; Low profile; low heat; TDP 65W, paired with an Intel ARC graphics Card that is powered by the PCI-e slot.Great Home Theatre PC. Amazed at how good Intel is getting.

read the online reviews and I'm not disappointed,very good value for money, works perfectly.highly recommended for a budget PC.
beast for gaming you'll never feel any bottlenecks with 99.9 % of any titlespair very nice with 4070ti.the temperatures are never over 60 under heavy load.if you care about longevity of cpu this is the best pick for you.
I got the i5-13600K to meet my immediate needs for my new HTPC build which is also used for video creation. Because I'm not in a real rush to create and edit my short videos, this processor is all I need now and in the immediate future. Realizing that the LGA1700 processors may end production soon, I can still upgrade to the i7 and i9 to keep pace with ubiquitous software bloat.
I just built my first pc and I decided to go with this intel CPU. The pc has been running great and I’ve had now issues with anything I’ve tried to do with it. It’s fast and can support both gaming and multitasking.
I have had no issues with this processor. The temps are low even when heavily gaming. This PC is gonna last a really long time.
Very nice CPU and easy to install. Always feels awkward holding this tiny piece of metal and mounting it to the motherboard. Handles the tasks I need and never had issues.
I have great fps, and it stays cool under load. I'm running a 360 water cooler with it, and 6khz ddr5 ram. Longevity remains to be seen, but so far I can say, good job Intel. Full ultra settings with no less than 60fps in GW2 with 150+ players on the screen. 150+fps. with small group battles.
Nice product.... You can go for it !!
I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against m
Using it with arctic freezer 34, even overclocked, temperature is great, and it is amazing for gaming and work. I am rendering in 3ds max much faster now! Incredible value for a professional cpu.
Been using this cpu for about a year now and it's amazing. For every game I play, some of which are known to be cpu intnesive, it has only gotten up to about 30% usage. Sure it is not a cheap cpu, but it definetly has the processing power despite being an i5. Even when I have stress tested it to 100% usage, it still easily stays cool with a vetroo v5 cooler. Plus you can brag to people that your cpu has 14 cores and 20 logical processors. great cpu, would recommend
I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it’s nearly double. I went 
No issues, added to my system after having an i7-7700k for 7 years and this cpu is worlds better, games are smoother and overall processes are faster. I’m glad I upgraded especially when paired with a 4070. This is a great upgrade option!
If you looking for a processor that won't break the bank, at the same time will give you plenty of performance for gaming and ever day work, then look no further. I upgraded from a i7 8700k, and the difference is night and day. I believe 13600kf is the best bang for your buck. Don't hesitate. You won't regret it.
went from ryzen 5800x to this and i do not regret it. especially with the ddr5 ram at higher speeds, computer flies even faster with editing tasks and mods.
Currently I have this cpu and my 4070ti connected to my 5120 x 1440 monitor. It does great. Never does this cpu lag and it rarely gets above 65 degrees. Even when the same cpu and gpu were connected to the 360hz monitor I have it never had an issue hitting 360 fps at 1080p in most titles.
Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident i
Out of all the Intel CPU,s the 13th gen I5’s definitely provide the best performance vs cost, I use it for a bit of CAD as well as gaming and have had no issues.
Very fast processor and also a horribe Room heater in India if you play games in non ac room on summer then prey the god
