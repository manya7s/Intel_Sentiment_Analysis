What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processer and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently.

Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do.
Does it’s job
Phenomenal processor, fast and easy to use! Using a 360mm cooler and never came close to heating up with some intense and long gaming sessions! Easy to use and tweak in the bios if you so desire!
Wanted to make sure my pc was future proof until Moronicsoft, sorry Microsoft decide to rob us again and make everyones pc obsolete again. Fantastic processor paired with a good cooler makes for the fastest porn you've ever seen, or work obviously i meant work.
Brand new out of the package, and doesn't look clean I see some missing areas also looks like a thumbprint and, I get a cpu error from the 2 motherboards I've tried. CPU looks like it was a refurbish. I cleaned it and look at the dirt!
I am normally an AMD person but recently ended up with an Intel custom rig. It had a low end intel CPU to start and I figured i would just upgrade to this instead of switching over to AMD again. Works wonderfully and it got rid of a bottleneck with the old CPU.
This latest i7 Intel chip is fast ,this 14th Gen chip is a worthy upgrade . Luv it !
I ordered 14700F because I need a CPU that has similar performance compared with 14700k but consumes less power, and I was wrong about it.1st of all, the CPU cooler come with the CPU is too weak and it limit the CPU to 65w with continuously load.The 65w power limitation severely undercut CPU performance and I get about 20,000 with Cinebench R23.A powerful cooler is definitely needed to cool down the CPU allowing it to run at 220w.With 220w on the 14700F, Cinebench R23 score has reached 33,000.For me, when 14700f paired with the original cooler, the 65w CPU is too weak for my need.In the meantime, with a powerful cooler, 14700f performs close (but not as fast) as 14700k and the 220w power consumpt
I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock

In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off).

Wow welcome to a real gaming cpu. This runs good, have not OC, stays cool with my 360aio. No stability issues, nothing but a great freakn experience. Very happy with this purchase.
Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these
I upgraded to this 13700k from an 8700k.Huge improvement in speed and general PC performance and whilst running msfs and general gaming.I water cool so temperature not much over 60'c.
This processor is absolutely incredible with no doubt’s… The only this you have to keep in mind that go for atleast 360 AIO for more better performance…
Most powerful cpu at this price bracket no doubt. Amazing performance.love it
This is my best buy so far for gaming and editing. It runs great whatever you throw. Excellent performance so far. Cinebench score is 29000 at 125 TDP.Suggestion: Buy only if you have very good amount of cooler.
good

This cpu is really amazing at everything. It does run very hot so I suggest getting a good AIO or air cooler. 100% would buy again
Built my brother a gaming PC and I paired this bad boy with a 3070 and it works amazing on 1440p. Max settings on Helldivers 2 getting 120+ FPS and Hell let lose is running about the same as well.
Intel is killing the competition. If you want an insanely fast PC, make this the heart of it. Or if you’re really feeling it go for an i9. I would recommend staying within the 13th generation as there’s not much about the 14th gen that makes it worth it. Out of the box this CPU will comfortably run at 5.4ghz, it performs amazing under load and in my system stays perfectly cool.This year-old CPU, blows away brand new CPU’s from the likes of Apple and AMD, I truly cannot recommend the 13th gen lineup enough, this being the centerpiece of it all.If you do get an LGA 1700 CPU, go ahead and get the bracket upgrade for your MOBO, it’ll save you time down the long run and helps to keep temps in check.
Nice ,powerful and reliable cpu
heavily dependent on motherboard settings, but this is enough power paired with a high end gpu to bring star citizen on its latest patch 3.19.1 as of this writing above 55 fps at 2160p on a 55 inch tv display.  I mention that game because for me, if i can run it stable, with a good amount of FPS, current patch performance issues not considered its what I wanted.my numero uno tip for you is - if you are getting HOT temps ... like 85C or close to that while gaming? you want to go turn off Intel adaptive boost technology in your bios.  research your board and see if you can undervolt. the intel fail safes that asus has setup on my board put voltage at 1.4+. using the asus typical setting its more li
This CPU slays for gaming and productivity! My one gripe is that they run very hot, even with a high end duel 120mm Air Cooler. Researched and this seems to be the norm with 13700K and 13900K, so unless you are going to plan on liquid cooling, I would definitely not recommend overclocking this thing. In fact, would probably recommend under-volting it for better temps.

Fast Runs smooth and cool. worth every penny.
The processor works great; however, I am unable to use xmp with my current msi motherboard. When I enable xmp, my system locks up; however, once I turn it back off, I am good to go.
I have this paired with my 1080gtx and it runs well Minecraft heavily modded with shaders on 1.12.2 forge you can run about 20 render distance *cpu starts to bottleneck even when the game is running on a server* at about 60fps for other less heavy cpu tasks like csgo r6 and other games run amazing
OK, it's a few generations old, but at <$200, it's a great buy!This is my first intel CPU since the i9-9820x, and, as expected, it runswonderfully.Paired with a Z690 refurb, and Teamgroup DDR5, I was able to update for less than $400.
My first pc build decided to go with this processor for price and capability.  Very capable processor for my new rig.
Was stuck on the fence between I9 and the I7 for my everyday needs. My focus was to future proof the next build because my first experience with intel ever was a good one. I went with an I7 build back in 2010 and that system outperforms lasting a good 8-9 years before encountering some issues with heating and performance. Compared to my current AMD build which unfortunately has only been around for 3 years experienced performance issues earlier on due to the higher demand these newer games require.Yeah I'm glad with my choice of going back to Intel. It feels like a solid choice and with the sales right now for the I7, now is a good time to buy this processor. Yeah, I'm missing out on like 4 cores
I bought this product which unfortunately was defective but it was such a fast, smooth communication and refund. As it was defective, my shipping was waived & full refund. Definitely recommend
Bought the wrong one, 12700K is what I need as it come with GPU builtin. The return and refund is smooth. Re-order the correct 12700K from Amazon. Great service :)
