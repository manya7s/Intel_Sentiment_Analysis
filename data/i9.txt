The Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may fin
Thought I'd give the CPU a try despite the reviews, hoping that the kinks had been ironed out since the stability problems had come to light. Nope. First day was fine, games worked great, CPU worked flawlessly. The next morning, first game I booted up crashed. Thought that was odd, tried again, and crashed again. Within about 15 minutes, I could no longer even open games that used UE5. Constant crashing in other CPU heavy tasks. I spent 8 hours troubleshooting my PC and doing research into the issue to come to the conclusion that everyone else having these symptoms also had i9-13900/14900 KS CPUs. Despite following the advice from ASUS and applying the intel CPU profile in the UEFI, the problems 
Performance and stability was excellent. I was able to achieve 5.9 Ghz by default stock clockspeed with my air cooler Noctua NH-D15. Yes, I had to adjust System Voltage via BIOS to ensure system stability, otherwise the game will crash which I recommend to set it between 1.11 V - 1.15V, otherwise leaving it by default may push SA voltage to around 2.10 - 3.00 V which is very dangerous to your memory controller. Yes, IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) does matter when it comes to RAM overclocking, however, not all RAM and CPU can achieve same clockspeed and volage due to silicon lottery. Other than that, I'm happy with the results, able to run much higher framerate, no frame drop during livestream
Like what is intel doing? Oh high SP score on the P cores ES IT! The P cores were meh, the E cores were even worse, the IMC was abysmal. Like it would not run 5600-8000mhz ddr5 constant, crashes, blue screens, instability, pc just locking up. Even tried it on two boards same thing the Apex Encore and the Rog Strix z790-E.... that both my 13900k and 14000k work on flawlessly. Asus support said the chip was faulty, so I returned it, not going to try and fight to make a dud hobble along.
Great CPU. You’re basically paying a premium to get the best binned part. Only problem is Intel love to shove power into these chips, causing extreme temperatures. Before I undervolted it, I was getting over 90 C and hitting 100 C at times. But since the KS has the highest bin, It is super easy to undervolt.
Used it on a z790 msi ace max, it was very unstable, insta crash while trying to run cinebench r23, crashing while gaming, I reached intel support and after some tweakings they ended up recommending to return it to Amazon as it was less than 30 days I had the cpu, I'm not trying this one anymore
Great processor.  Very power hungry. I needed 1176 watts for everything so make sure to plan accordingly.  Even just the CPU and my old 3080 GPU needed 1050 watts.
Needs to be watched  as far cooling with a fan. Deep Cool Assasin works with this processor.
When you pair it with a motherboard like the MSI Z790 Godlike Max, this CPU is stable and happy. No complaints, I knew what I was buying and got it.
You need a very good cooling system for these chips has i found out I had to switch off the boost in the biosfor now until I can afford A decent cooler I bought a CORSAIR iCUE LINK H150i RGB which was clearly no good. I,ve been reading some reviews and it looks like the ASUS ROG Ryujin III 360 ARGB might do the job but quite expensive but still looking at the reviews on that so if you have not got a very good cooler you will blue screen so hit that boost off in the bios...
I've had the worst luck with 14th Gen i9 bins. After only 1 month of overall decent stability, I'm just now starting to get random CRC failures when extracting archives, blue screens, game crashes; even despite having run on Intel's new power profiles since the start (from post-May-deadline set by Intel on Motherboard manufacturers) designed to avoid damaging the CPUs while Intel explores their RMA nightmare; and this CPU still managed to experience serious degradation not unlike other high end i9s in the Raptor Lake Refresh.I've already upgraded from a 14900K to a 14900KS (14900K lasted 6 months before RMA too), but this 14900KS here only lasted less than 30 days before 14th gen CPU-gate issues 
So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in 
Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on "Disabled-Enforce all limits" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade d
So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but
I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Ga
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you. I got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call 
I don't liked the price of it .I Also don't liked the performance of it .Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.
I wanted a CPU that had the following features:1) Low wattage for an ITX motherboard and case with 300W power supply2) Lots of cores for Windows Server 20223) Would work with Asrock Z690M-ITX/ax motherboard4) Cheaper than Xenon CPUI updated the motherboard BIOS to the latest version. Everything worked great. This CPU is quite new being released in the 1st quarter of 2024. I didn't want buy an expensive Xenon CPU which severely limits my choice of motherboards in the low-price range (i.e. Supermicro).
The processor is great!The included heat sink and fan is garbage.Just in BIOS the idle temp was around 65C spiking above 70C.It doesn't cover the entire surface of the processor.
I do 3D modeling for game design. With the “14th gen I9 CPU” I can load up an entire complex city (with roads, trees and vehicle) rotate and view a 3.1 million Poly count city from any angle in (120 fps) real time.
First off, I had the KF version and it ran 6.2ghz with "auto oc", so good numbers, BUT editing in Premiere wasn't great.  I found an obscure article about smartsync that uses the onboard GPU along with your discrete GPU to greatly increase efficiency for H264/H265 encodes.  In other words, it renders twice as fast for live views when editing vs the K and KF.  It's not a great gaming GPU, but it's better than nvidia for encoding just looking at benchmarks.  Software is still the best quality and it's on par with GPU exports, which is a great option when you want quality over speed.  For Asus boards, you'll need to enable it in BIOS to see it show up in Premiere options/Media.  I've had K versions 
I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task 
My primary use case for the 12900k is gaming and encoding video. Personally I could justify the higher price tag over the competing i5 and i7 because of my specific use case.Good Things:The processor is absolutely and insanely powerful. I am encoding 1080, 30fps video roughly 50% to 80% faster give or take than my previous processor which was a 11700kf! One single generation and an i9 upgrade has saved me astronomical amounts of time. As far as gaming goes… I would say is more heavily reliant on a graphics card so I won’t go into much detail on that. Overall this processor is wonderful and deserves its 5 stars.Not so good things:I didn’t take a star off for this because it isn’t really a problem 
This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that
Works great in my new system. I wouldn't say easy to install, but none are, I always sweat bullets when I latch down the CPU holder. But other than that stable and powerful.

Make sure you have a good Aio  NOT an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 80-90c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly.
This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742
Bought for a friend's computer I was building. I got it in the Prime sale and it's fantasticly fast
I brought this processor for my gaming/workstation build .Combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling AIO , things went smoothly.It can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering , simulation , gaming , yet keeps temprature at 40c .Highly recommended for best gaming rigs .Note: 4th gen ssd is a plus for the build ... Otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works .
Was using amd cpu untill now. Cpu died in 2 year only. Now back to intel. Dad of AMD .
Product is good Price is high wait for prices to go down dont buy overpriced products. It's gives seller more power over us.

It did not come with the box in the image, it came with a standard box like the i7
It's not Amazon's issue but the processor I bought is faulty. I'm experiencing crashes while playing games. It's so annoying and so time-consuming. I had so many stressful moments because of this.
Cool processor
This processor is all-rounder for every tasks you do on PC from small to CPU intensive applications. If you are looking for vast performance with heavy production tasks this is very nice to have. Best to use with Motherboard DDR5 and PCI-E 5.0 supported motherboards.
Thanks a lot
The Intel Core i9 13900K is an absolute powerhouse! Its blazing speeds and unrivaled performance have transformed my computing experience. Multitasking is a breeze, and demanding applications run seamlessly. The advanced technology and impressive efficiency make it a must-have for any tech enthusiast. Truly a 5-star gem!I recommend this CPU for 8K gaming and stream.
Not the best It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened

Best investment I ever made when it comes to a gaming/streaming pc. I’m a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing I’ve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesn’t disappoint. Now, this review isn’t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if you’re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etc…. Then this is the right cpu for you. I’m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. I’m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the 
I have had to switch to AMD to get good CPU but it is never the same as an INTEL chip.  I have it with 64G (2 X 32) of G.SKILL Trident Z5 RGB 6400MHZ RAM on a Gigabyte Z790 AORUS ELITE AX Board.  Perfectly stable and overclock.
thank you its great
The Intel Core i9-13900KF is an absolute beast! From the moment I upgraded to this 13th generation CPU, everything has been running very smoothly. My DaVinci Resolve playback on 4K is now smooth with zero choppiness or freezing, a remarkable improvement compared to my old setup. I'm blown away by its speed and performance, making it a game-changer for my work and entertainment. Highly recommend this powerhouse CPU for anyone seeking top-notch performance! 💻🔥
This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases. 
You know what to expect from INTEL i9 and that is what you get.
my son are built a pc gamer whit this bad boy he is more close to finish thanks guys
Great price and great processors and was shipped very well and safe.
This is essentially a 13700K that is 1 gen earlier. But you don't have the issues of Raptor Lake (and "14th Gen" Raptor Lake refresh) becoming unstable and eventually dying. 13th (and 14th) i7s and i9s from Intel have been having stability issues yet 12th Gen seems to run just fine without issues.
The box is different than what it say on amazon picture .but it is the original.
This has everything i wanted in a CPU lot's of cores and threads for heavy editing and for gaming this might be the best gaming CPU i have had and some will till you it gets hot or uses a lot of wattage but i went in the bios and fine tuned it now even with it running 100% i never go above 80C and my last cinebench score was over 28.000 not bad for a 348.00 CPU i do recommend this i don't think you will be un-happy and it will give you many years of service.P.S.i also recommend using an anti bending plate Good luck.
Cannot complain for its price, almost good as an i7 13700K.
